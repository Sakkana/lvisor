/**
 * rdtsc() - returns the current TSC without ordering constraints
 *
 * rdtsc() returns the result of RDTSC as a 64-bit integer.  The
 * only ordering constraint it supplies is the ordering implied by
 * "asm volatile": it will put the RDTSC in the place you expect.  The
 * CPU can and will speculatively execute that RDTSC, though, so the
 * results can be non-monotonic if compared on different CPUs.
